# Git-Introduction


I have learned some basic fundamentals of github including all the use and purpose of Github. Its importance to developers as being the top platform for all developers around the world. I have learned the basic functions and operations which includes creating repositories, forking it, cloning it, and more. 
I am still confused overall but will learn about it on the succeeding days.
